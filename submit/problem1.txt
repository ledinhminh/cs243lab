Useful parts:
each line has format (h1,f1,h2,f2). If h1.f1 are different from h2.f2, it can
be useful in debugging.

Noisy parts:
1. h1=h2 and f1=f2. Since each object is always an alias of itself. This is
not useful.

2. For each (h1,f1,h2,f2), there is a duplicate row, which swaps the order of
the alias, ie (h2,f2,h1,f1). We only need one copy for debugging.
